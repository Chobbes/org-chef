* Introduction

  org-chef is a package for managing recipes in org-mode. One of the
  main features is that it can automatically extract recipes from
  websites like allrecipes.com

* Org-Capture

  It's recommended that you set up an org-capture template to capture
  recipes. Here is an example of that:

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (setq org-capture-templates
          '(("c" "Cookbook" entry (file "~/org/cookbook.org")
             "%(org-chef-get-recipe-from-url)"
             :empty-lines 1)))
  #+END_SRC

  When capturing to the cookbook it will prompt you for a URL, you can
  then paste a URL like the following into the mini-buffer, and it
  will fill in as many details as it can:

  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/85452/homemade-black-bean-veggie-burgers/

* Inserting at Point

  You can also insert a recipe at point using the command
  ~org-chef-insert-recipe~.
