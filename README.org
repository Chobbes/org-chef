* Introduction

  org-chef is a package for managing recipes in org-mode. One of the
  main features is that it can automatically extract recipes from
  websites like allrecipes.com

* Installation

  org-chef is available on MELPA!

  I manage my packages via [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]. I have added this to my
  ~.emacs~ file to install org-chef:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

    (require 'use-package)

    (use-package org-chef
      :ensure t)
  #+END_SRC

* Org-Capture

  It's recommended that you set up an org-capture template to capture
  recipes. Here is an example of that:

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (setq org-capture-templates
          '(("c" "Cookbook" entry (file "~/org/cookbook.org")
             "%(org-chef-get-recipe-from-url)"
             :empty-lines 1)))
  #+END_SRC

  When capturing to the cookbook it will prompt you for a URL, you can
  then paste a URL like the following into the mini-buffer, and it
  will fill in as many details as it can. Here is an example recipe:

  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/85452/homemade-black-bean-veggie-burgers/

  Which will be extracted to something like the following:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,* Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers
      :PROPERTIES:
      :source-url: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/85452/homemade-black-bean-veggie-burgers/

    ,** Ingredients

       - 1 (16 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
       - 1/2 green bell pepper, cut into 2 inch pieces
       - 1/2 onion, cut into wedges
       - 3 cloves garlic, peeled
       - 1 egg
       - 1 tablespoon chili powder
       - 1 tablespoon cumin
       - 1 teaspoon Thai chili sauce or hot sauce
       - 1/2 cup bread crumbs
    ,** Directions

       1. If grilling, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil a sheet of aluminum foil. If baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and lightly oil a baking sheet.
       2. In a medium bowl, mash black beans with a fork until thick and pasty.
       3. In a food processor, finely chop bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Then stir into mashed beans.
       4. In a small bowl, stir together egg, chili powder, cumin, and chili sauce.
       5. Stir the egg mixture into the mashed beans. Mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is sticky and holds together. Divide mixture into four patties.
       6. If grilling, place patties on foil, and grill about 8 minutes on each side. If baking, place patties on baking sheet, and bake about 10 minutes on each side.
